# UofT Intelligent Agents Assignments (Course #3547)

This repository contains my own work completed as part of **Course #3547 – Intelligent Agents**
at the **University of Toronto School of Continuing Studies**, within the
**Artificial Intelligence Certificate Program**.

The course focuses on designing **intelligent software agents** that can reason about their
environment, plan actions, and make decisions under constraints and uncertainty, combining
search, logic, probabilistic reasoning, evolutionary algorithms, and reinforcement learning.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

Across assignments and the term project, this repository covers:

- Agent–environment interaction and perception
- Problem solving as search (heuristics, A*, optimization)
- Constraint satisfaction and planning
- Logical and knowledge-based agents
- Probabilistic reasoning and decision-making under uncertainty
- Evolutionary algorithms and genetic algorithms
- Reinforcement learning fundamentals
- Applying intelligent agents to real-world business and optimization problems

## 🧪 Assignments Overview

### Assignment 1 — Agent Environment and Reasoning
Design and implementation of an agent operating in a structured environment, focusing on
perception, internal state, and basic reasoning about actions and outcomes.

### Assignment 2 — Planning, Search, and Constraints
Application of classical AI search and planning techniques, including heuristics and constraint
satisfaction, to guide agent decision-making.

### Assignment 3 — Probabilistic Reasoning
Use of probabilistic models to enable agents to reason and act under uncertainty, incorporating
belief updates and probabilistic inference.

## 🏁 Term Project

The term project applies intelligent-agent techniques to a **non-trivial optimization problem**,
emphasizing:

- Formal problem formulation
- Agent design and decision logic
- Trade-offs between competing objectives
- Evaluation of solution quality

The project was completed **individually**. All code and analysis included in this repository
were authored by me.
